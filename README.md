##Description
---
This is a Website that is an activity planning app. It takes your activities you make and filters through a weather api to find days that fit your activities you have set in your desired location. As well as you can see others activities and posts as well, it will soon have more functionality to be more like a social media app.

##How to use
---
-The landing page is a page to log in or sign up. To sign up enter some info that will be used to make an account. 
- after signing in you can 'make an activity' where you set the parameters to a certain activiy you would like to do(ex Name:"Rock Climbing", Min Temp:"60 degrees", Max Temp:"80 degrees", Daylight:"yes", ect.)
- that activity is saved to your account and now you can 'search a day' on different activities you have saved for either your location or another location you desire. When you have the activity and you search for day it will search the next 8 days and return the days and times of day that fit your activity parameters.
- After you find a day you like you can post that day with a title and description of what you will do so you and others can see.
- In the app as well you have the option to update or delete your profile, activities, and posts.
